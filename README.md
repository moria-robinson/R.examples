Issue orienting images (custom-made; external image files) radially around a circular phylogeny

"tree.out" shows the output of the script

"desired.tree" is the desired output (made in photoshop for illustration purposes only)

See script for instructions to download image files. If located in downloads folder, script should run as-is; otherwise will need to specify path to the six .png files.
